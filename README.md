# DinoSite
A premium site selling dinosaurs to wealthy customers who need a dinosaur for their new, ill-fated dinosaur park/backyard experience.
Created as part of a learning project for the Frameworks and Architectures for the Web course during Spring 2021 at ITU.

# Features
Currently runs simply as a primitive webpage from VSCode using Livepreview. Coded primarily in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, later to be
updated to some more modern frameworks hopefully. :)

That said, currently has about 35 dinosaurs that are organized by size, diet or manufacturer. These assets are rendered from a single storage file to HTML pages through HTML injection. The intent was to reduce code bloat, although the injection is perhaps a bit clunky, it acts somewhat like a crude framework.
